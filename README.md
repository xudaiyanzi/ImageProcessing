# ImageProcessing

This project is designed to help beginners in computer vision to process  an image/video in OpenCV. It has 8 steps:

1) use open cv to read an image or video
2) understand the color channels in each pixel
3) resize the image with fixed x/y values or fx/fy values
4) sharp or blur the image to emphasize the main content inside the image
5) detect the edge
6) draw
7) create contours in the image
8) d

After practice the steps above, a developer would be confortable in preprocessing the image/videos with openCV. These contents are inspired by the YouTube Tutorials from "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDIj5LuIL4A&t=2082s", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o&t=65s", and "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSqxn6zGE0c&t=764s".
