# ImageProcessing

This project is helping the CV beginners to learn the first step in computer vision: process an image. It includes two parts: 1) understand the presentation of an image, including the pixels, RGB (or BGR), the coordinates, and the size; 2) master the image processing method, including tweaking and transforming the photos for future CV model training and testing.
