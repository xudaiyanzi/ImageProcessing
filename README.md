# ImageProcessing

This project is designed to help beginners in computer vision learn the foundational step: processing an image. It is divided into three main parts:

1. **Understanding Image Representation**
   This includes concepts such as pixels, resolution (PPI - pixels per inch), color spaces (e.g., RGB/BGR, grayscale, HSV), coordinates, and image size.
2. **Exploring Common Tweaking and Transformation Methods**
   Learn techniques such as scaling, rotation, cropping, affine transformations, and perspective transformations.
3. **Preparing Images for Processing**
   This involves:
   1. normalization (scaling pixel values to a range of 0 to 1)
   2. image augmentation (e.g., rotating, flipping, zooming, and adjusting lighting).
   3. dataset splitting (training, validation, and testing data)
